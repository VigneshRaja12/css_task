    <p id="p1"> camera is an optical instrument that captures a visual image.
        At a basic level, cameras consist of sealed boxes (the camera body),
        with a small hole (the aperture) that allows light through to capture
        an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually a digital sensor or photographic film). 
        Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive 
        surface. Lenses focus the light entering the camera. The aperture can be narrowed or widened.
         A shutter mechanism determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to light.
         The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography. Captured images may be 
         reproduced later as part of the process of photography, digital imaging, or photographic printing.
          Similar artistic fields in the moving-image camera domain are film, videography, and cinematography.
         The word camera found by Abu Ali al-Hasan bin al-Hasan bin al-Haitsam or Ibnu al-Haitsam, known as Alhazen comes from camera obscura, the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image onto a flat surface (literally translated to "dark chamber"). The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce
